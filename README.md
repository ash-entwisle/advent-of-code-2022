# AOC-2022

My code for the 2022 Advent of Code. Each repo will be made public the day after the challenge is released. I will try to keep the code clean, but Im using this as an oppertunity to improve my skills in Rust, so it might not be the best code. The writeups found in each repos `README` lay out my thought process, but are mostly for my benefit to get my thoughts down. At some point I will go through the writeups and clean them up. All of the code is licensed under MIT, so feel free to use it for whatever you want, Ill add the licensefiles to each repo when I get around to it.
